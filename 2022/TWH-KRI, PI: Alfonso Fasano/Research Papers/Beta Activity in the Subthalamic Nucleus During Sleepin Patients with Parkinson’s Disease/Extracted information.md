[Beta Activity in the Subthalamic Nucleus During Sleep in Patients with Parkinson's Disease](https://movementdisorders.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/mds.22351)

## Abstract
- "We describe, for the first time, the **changes in activity of the subthlamic nucleus (STN) during different sleep stages in Parkinson's disease with special interest in the beta band**."
- "**Ten patients with PD treated with deep brain stimulation of the STN were studied**. **Subthalamic local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded** through the stimulation electrodes **during wakefulness ("off" medication) and different sleep stages**."
- "**In Stage 2 and slow-wave sleep, a significant decrease of beta activity was recorded. During REM sleep, beta power values were similar to wakefulness values or even higher.**"
- "These findings indicate that **STN activity is modulated and modified during different sleep stages**. The incrased beta activity during REM sleep is a new but unexpected finding which requires further analysis."

## Introduction
- "The implantation of electrodes for deep brain stimulation in the internal part of the globus pallidus or in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) to treat motor complications in Parkinson's disease (PD) has provided a unique opportunity to record directly electricaly activity from the human basal ganglia."
- "**A relatively typical pattern of oscillatory activities in different frequency bands has been described in the STN of PD patients.**"
    - "**In the "off" medication state, the STN shows a prominent activity in the beta range (13-30 Hz), which is attenuated in the "on" medication state [1,3]**. In the "on" state, oscillations in higher frequencies (high hamme band (60-90 Hz), or even as high as 300 Hz) can be recorded [4,6]. Finally, theta oscillations (4-10 Hz) associated to the presence of levodopa-induced dyskinesias have also been described [7]."
- "**The oscillatory changes in the beta band appear particularly interesting. Because voluntary movement is preceded by significant reduction in their power both in the motor cortex [8,9] and STN [10,11], it has been suggested that the subthalamic oscillations i nteh beta band may play a role in bradykinesia in PD [12].** However, there is no direct proof for such relationship yet."

## Patients and methods
### Patients
- "Ten patients with PD who had undergone bilateral implantation of electrodes in the STN for treatment with DBS were included in the study. **All the recordings were carried out between 2 and 4 days after the surgery, having ensured that the patients' general state was satisfactory.** The sleep periods analyzed corresponded to naps during the early afternoon (after lunch) in 5 cases and whole nigh sleep in the remaining five."

### Signal recording
- Recorded signals using: "**intracerebral depth electrodes implanted into the STN bilaterally, scalp electrodes, EOG and EMG of limb muscles.**"

### Sample selection and analysis
- "Sleep staging was performed using the **Rechtschaffen and Kales criteria [17]**."

### Measurement of beta band power by spectral analysis
- "The **power spectrum was determined using the fast Fourier transform (FFT) function** in the Spike 2 software. ... The **signal power was converted to log-scale to obtain a more Gaussian distribution [18]**."
- "All the power spectra were visually reviewed to identify peaks at different frequencies. The channels showing the clearest peak in the beta band during the "off" medication state,  each STN, were selected for additional analysis.""

### Measurement of cortical-STN coherence
- "The coherence between the STN channels showing the clearest peaks and the cortex (Cz) was computed in Spike 2 software using blocks of 1,024 points. The **coherence was calculated from the cross spectral density or csd between the two waveforms normalized by the power spectral density or psd of each waveform**. The coherence at some frequency f was given by: coh(f)= (|sum csd~ab~(f)|^2)/(sum psd~a~(f)*sum psd~b~(f))"

## Discussion
- "In our patients, the **STN LFP power in the beta band during Stage 2 and 4 of sleep was lower than the power during wakefulness,** with a fast transition, and increased during the REM stage."
    - "This is the first evidence of a modulation of neuronal activity during sleep in main basal ganglia nuclei in humans. **This observation is conceptually important because the basal ganglia have been traditionally thought to keep a fairly permanent level of activity,** regarding both the dopaminergic system and the neuronal firing of the output nuclei, including the STN."
- "The abnormal oscillatory LFP activity in the beta range recorded from the STN in "off" PD patients has been previously reported by several groups [3,5,7,22]."
    - "There is a **positive correlation between the amount of beta activity in the STN in "off" and the motor improvement of the patietns with dopaminergic therapy [1,23].** Thus, the **abnormal subthalamic beta activity might be considered a marker of dopaminergic depletion.**"
- "The beta power during REM sleep increased to levels higher than those observed during wakefulness, which at first, may appear to conflict with a recent study describing the restoration of an apparently normal motor control during REM sleep in PD patients with REM behaviour disorder (RBD) [13]."
    - "... **it has previously been hypothesized that there might be, within the broad beta band, more specific patterns of activity [3,27].**"
    - "Interestingly, in our study, the power increase observed during REM sleep with atonia affected almost exclusively the high-beta range, which is less influenced by anti-Parkinsonian medication [3], while the power of the low-beta range only increased when muscle activity was observed."
    - "In addition, a new peak appeared during REM sleep in the limit between the alpha and beta bands (10-20 Hz). In our opinion, th epossible relationship between this peak and motor control is supported by two factsL on one hadn this peak was more evidence when there was muscle activity in the EMG and, on the other hand, the STN channels showing this 10-20 Hz peak during REM sleep coincided with the channels showing the increase in the beta LFP power during wakefulness."
- "In summary, LFP activity in the stn in "off" PD patients is modified by sleep. In Stages 2 and 4, a reduction in the abnormal beta activity can be observed affecting all STN contact in pairs but more significant in those channels showing a prominent basal beta peak. In REM sleep, beta activity surpasses the "awake" values, especially during REM without atonia, althought the effect smay be different for the low and high beta bands."
