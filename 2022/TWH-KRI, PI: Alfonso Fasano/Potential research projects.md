# Potential research projects
## Work with:
- Programming: MATLAB, databases, cloudbases
- Math: fourier transform
- File types: JSON files, CSV files (can be opened in excel, etc.)

## Decomposing local field potentials:
Use fourier transform on local field potentials measured by device for deep brain stimulation

## Building a database/cloudbase:
- Device in chest for deep brain stimulation typically associated with a distinct computer for doctors/researchers to analyse/work with
  - Poses issues:
    - If computer is broken, lost, etc.
    - Is inconvenient, must be passed on from doctor/researcher to next person working with it
- Building a database/cloudbase to facilitate work on device for analysing measurements from and programming deep brain stimulation

## Questionnaire based scales for patients
- Building a database/cloudbase to transfer results to a computer and compile

## Working with data from walking:
- Parkinsonâ€™s walking virtual reality
- Separate treads for each foot to measure walking from each foot (imbalances, etc.)
