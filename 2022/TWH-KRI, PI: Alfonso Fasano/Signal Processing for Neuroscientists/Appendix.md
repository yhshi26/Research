# Appendix
From [Signal Processing for Neuroscientists by Wim van Drongelen](https://faculty.washington.edu/seattle/brain-physics/textbooks/drongelen.pdf)

This appendix provides a quick reference to some basic laws frequently used to analyze problems in neurobiology and that are cited throughout this text (Fig. A1.1). A further explanation of these laws can be found in any basic physics textbook.

Ohm’s law: The potential difference V (V, or volt) over a conductor with resistance R (Ω — Ohm) and current I (A, or ampère) can be related by V = iR.

Kirchhoff’s first law: At a junction, all currents add up to 0: ∑i=0 

Kirchhoff’s second law: In a circuit loop, all potentials add up to 0: ∑V=0

Magnetic flux induces a potential difference: V=-dΦ~b~/dt

Capacitance-related equations: The potential difference V between the two conductors of a capacitor is the quotient of charge Q (C, or Coulomb) and capacitance C (F, or Fahrad): V=Q/C or Q=CV

Current is the derivative of the charge Q:
i = dQ/dt and Q=∫idt

Capacitance C is proportional to the quotient of surface area S (m^2^, or square meter) of the conductors and their interdistance d: C=ε(S/d)
